# Getting started

Welcome to the On-Chain for Http File System (ONCHFS) main documentation. ONCHFS is a permissionless unix-like content-addressable file system fully stored on-chain designed to be delivered through the http protocol, with cross-blockchain compatibility in mind.

ONCHFS is inspired by [ethfs](https://github.com/holic/ethfs), [ipfs](https://ipfs.tech/), [bitcoin ordinals recursive inscriptions](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html), [Unix filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem), and aims at providing a general framework for working with files stored on-chain, following modern standards & practices.
