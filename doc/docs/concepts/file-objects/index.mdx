# File Objects

File Objects are data structures that describe a file system object such as a [file](todo) or a [directory](todo). File Objects are inspired by [UNIX inodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode). Each File Object stores attributes or Content-Store locations of the object's data.

A File Objects contract provides higher-level instructions over the Content-Store to describe and organise files. The contract keeps a table of File Object, inspired by [inodes on UNIX-stye file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode). An inode can be either a **file** or a **directory**, referenced by their 32 bytes hash in the lookup table.

**A file** is an ordered list of Content-Store pointers and some metadata describing the file (type, encoding).

**A directory** is a list of inodes with their assigned names. Contrary to inodes on UNIX-style file systems, directories only point to their children (they cannot reference their parent nor themselves by design).

The File Object contract supports high level instructions to interact with the file system, such as:

- `write_chunk()`
- `read_chunk()`
- `create_file()`
- `read_file()`
- `create_directory()`
- `read_directory()`
- `get_inode_at()`

Each File Object is Content-Addressed in a File Objects table. File & Directory inodes are hashed in a way that ensures that for each file or directory there is a single hash of their content. Such a hash is used to index the inodes in a lookup table for later retrieval. This hash is referred to as `CID (Content IDentifier)`.

CIDs are used as entry points to the file system, as such the File System doesn't provide any way to explore file objects from its root but using object CIDs. In other words, external systems need to keep track of such CIDs in their respective applications.

Following is an illustration of the File Objects lookup table (_note that this isn't how the content of objects is layed down, just a representation for the purpose of the illustration_):

| cid              | Content                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x7856de7ea...` | `file; pointers:[...]; metadata:...`                  |
| `0xf7ab6538b...` | `directory; index.html:0x78...; main.js:0xf4...; ...` |
| `0x45f6f7120...` | `file; pointers:[...]; metadata:...`                  |
| ...              | ...                                                   |
