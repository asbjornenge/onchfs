/**
 * Computes all the necessary data for the inscription of the file on-chain.
 * Performs the following tasks in order:
 *  - infer/detect the mime-type from the filename/content
 *  - compress the content in gzip using zopfli, but only use the compressed
 *    bytes if they are smaller in size than the raw content
 *  - build the metadata object from previous steps, and encode the metadata in
 *    the format supported by the blockchain
 *  - chunk the content of the file
 *  - compute the CID of the file based on its content & its metadata
 * @param name The filename, will only be used to infer the Mime Type (a magic number cannot be used for text files so this is the privileged method)
 * @param content Byte content of the file, as a Buffer
 * @param chunkSize Max number of bytes for chunking the file content
 * @returns A file node object with all the data necessary for its insertion
